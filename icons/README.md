To update the `icons.blp` file using Photoshop:

1. Download the BLP file format plugin:

        https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/photoshop-blp-format-plugin

2. Download the PNG=>BLP converter program:

        https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info14110-BLPConverter.html

3. Edit `icons.psd` and save the result as `icons.png`. The plugin is supposed
to be able to save directly as BLP but I get a disk error.

4. Run the following the convert to BLP:

        ./BLPConverter.exe icons.png
